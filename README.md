# Temperature Diffusivity with PDE Method
In this section, the user is asked to input the values of variables that have been determined. The required variables are:

* **T0**                  = initial Temperature (K)

* **T1**                  = Temperature at Location 1 (K)

* **Tn**                  = Temperature at Location n (K)

* **k**                   = Material Conductivity (W/m.K)

* **Density**             = Material Density (Kg/m3)

* **Cp**                  = Specific Heat Capacity (J/Kg.K))

* **Length**              = Distance (m)

* **n (i)**               = the number of sections

* **dx**                  = distance between each section (m)

* **dt**                  = time  (Second)

* **nt**                  = interval per time step
